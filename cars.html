<h2>Intro</h2> 

<p> <b>Mercedes</b> and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.
 <b>Mercedes-Benz AG</b> (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart,
  Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles badged 
  as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are
   managed by Daimler Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. In 2018, 
Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car, 
seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen  financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886<sup><a href="some source.com ">[11]</a></sup> 
 and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol 
 engine, introduced later that year.The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft nitrogen Na<sub>2</sub>
  (DMG).</p>


  <p>Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, a Jewish-Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the trademark in 
  1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing
   strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society. At the time, it was a 
   meeting place for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild 
   family and other wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well,
    including to billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek 
    drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand. In 
    1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz
     branded vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz 
  company on 28 June of the same year.</p>

    <h2>The off-road luxury liner.</h2>

    <p>With the Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet, the off-road icon proves that unique luxury can always be 
         elevated and refined. The “G” keeps reinventing itself and once again shows the potential that still lies
          in this off-road classic, which has been in production since 1979.</p>
